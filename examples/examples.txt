To see examples for this distribution, it is recommended you read the test 
scripts included under ./t, which cover the basic usage of the modules.

I may add further examples should the need ever arise. If you have any example
scripts that use the distribution in an unusual way or make good use of all the
features available, please feel free to submit one. If submitting an example
script, please sure to include the following in your POD:
