Test::CPAN::Meta
================

DESCRIPTION

Validation of the META.yml file in a CPAN distribution.

This module was written to ensure that a META.yml file, provided with a 
standard distribution uploaded to CPAN, meets the specifications that are
slowly being introduced to module uploads, via the use of package makers and
installers such as ExtUtils::MakeMaker, Module::Build and Module::Install.

Current META.yml Specification, 1.4, was finally approved on 23 June 2008.
