Test-CPAN-Meta
==============

DESCRIPTION

Validate your CPAN META.yml files.

This distribution was written to ensure that a META.yml file, provided with a 
standard distribution uploaded to CPAN, meets the specifications that are
slowly being introduced to module uploads, via the use of package makers and
installers such as ExtUtils::MakeMaker, Module::Build and Module::Install.

Current CPAN META Specification, 2.0, was finally approved in April 2010, 
which forms the basis for the contents of a META.json file. The full 
specification is now included with the CPAN-Meta distribution.
